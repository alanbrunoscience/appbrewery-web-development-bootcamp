        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a professional with over 11 years of experience in the
            technology sector, dedicated to acquiring and improving soft and
            hard skills that enable me to lead high-performance teams and
            develop impactful software solutions that make customers' daily
            lives easier.<br /><br />

            In the technical area, I contribute to the creation and planning of
            workflows focused on the CI/CD process, automating flows such as
            automated test execution, code quality validation, building and
            deploying microservices, web applications, and low-code in cloud
            providers such as AWS and Azure. Python played a central role in
            many of these initiatives.<br /><br />

            In the management area, I guided cross-functional teams, promoting
            alignment between strategic vision and technical execution. My work
            included developing high-performance teams, integrating processes
            and people, solving problems, delivering consistent results, and
            managing conflicts with a focus on a sense of urgency and
            efficiency.<br /><br />

            Driven by the development of technology, people, and products, I
            constantly seek opportunities to push boundaries and foster
            innovation in software development, with a focus on full stack
            solutions that generate a positive and significant impact on the
            industry. Let's connect to explore ways in which we can collaborate
            and shape the future of technology together.
